# SilenceDetectorAlarm

Don't you just love it when presenters take the station off air for kicks?
With this dodgy script now you'll know exactly when they broke it! Time to run to the station and probably fix something with studio transferring

Now extended to send other station status' to our dashboard!

# Installation

Simply run ./install.sh on your target raspberry pi and away you go.

The package will be installed as a system service at: SilenceDetector.service
